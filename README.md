# Medication Guide

An open-source, free-to-use, interactive tool that helps users select the appropriate over-the-counter medication based on their symptoms and needs.

## How it works

To understand how the recommendation engine works, start by exploring the `questions.ts` file in the `src/interactive` folder. This file contains all the questions and answer choices used to guide users toward the most suitable medication.
