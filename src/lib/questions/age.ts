While ibuprofen remains more effective for treatment of inflammation, it is contraindicated in neonates and children with asthma or during varicella. In addition, it poses a risk of dehydration and should therefore not be given during episodes of diarrhea or vomiting.`,

While ${paracetamolAcetaminophen()} and ibuprofen have well-established safety profiles for children, naproxen has not been studied as extensively in this age group, resulting in more conservative recommendations against its use in patients under 16 years of age.`,

				aspirin: {

					explanation: {
						short: 'Not safe for children < 16',
						long: `Aspirin is contraindicated in children under 16 years of age due to its association with Reye's syndrome. This rare but potentially fatal condition affects the brain and liver, typically following viral infections. After epidemiological studies in the 1980s established this connection, the incidence of Reye's syndrome declined dramatically. Alternative analgesics such as ${paracetamolAcetaminophen()} or ibuprofen offer comparable efficacy without this serious risk.`,
