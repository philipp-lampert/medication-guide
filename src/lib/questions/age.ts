This rare but potentially fatal condition affects the brain and liver, typically following viral infections. Epidemiological studies in the 1980s established this connection. The incidence of Reye's syndrome declined dramatically after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were implemented. Alternative analgesics such as paracetamol offer comparable efficacy without this serious risk.",
