						short: 'Not anti-inflammatory',
						long: `${paracetamolAcetaminophen(true)} provides only minimal anti-inflammatory benefit due to its weak peripheral action. While effective for pain relief through central nervous system mechanisms, it does not significantly reduce tissue inflammation, swelling, or redness. This makes ${paracetamolAcetaminophen()} ineffective for conditions where inflammation is the primary symptom.`,

It works directly at the site of inflammation, making it appropriate for conditions like joint pain, muscle injuries, and inflammatory disorders. Its rapid onset and good tissue penetration provide efficient symptom control when used appropriately.',
