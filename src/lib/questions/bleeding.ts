This effect persists throughout the dosing interval and substantially elevates hemorrhage risk in patients with bleeding disorders, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, or concurrent use of anticoagulants. Clinical studies show increased incidence of both minor and major bleeding events in susceptible populations. Ibuprofen is contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders or high risk for hemorrhagic complications. All patients with bleeding tendencies should consult their healthcare provider before using this medication.',

						short: 'Slightly increases bleeding risk',
						long: `Evidence regarding ${paracetamolAcetaminophen()}'s effect on bleeding risk is mixed. Most studies show no significant increase, making it the preferred analgesic for patients with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulants. While some recent research suggests a slight increase in bleeding risk at therapeutic doses, this effect is substantially weaker than with NSAIDs. ${paracetamolAcetaminophen(true)} remains the safest analgesic option for patients with bleeding disorders or hemorrhage history, though healthcare provider consultation is still recommended for those with severe bleeding risk factors.`,

Its long half-life (12-17 hours) results in sustained effects, potentially increasing bleeding risk compared to shorter-acting NSAIDs.

				aspirin: {
					value: 0,
					explanation: {
						short: 'High risk of serious bleeding',
						long: "Aspirin carries the highest bleeding risk among common analgesics due to its irreversible effect on platelet function, which persists for the platelets' entire 7-10 day lifespan. This makes aspirin particularly hazardous for patients with bleeding disorders, hemorrhage history, or those on anticoagulants. Clinical evidence demonstrates substantially increased rates of gastrointestinal, intracranial, and surgical site bleeding in vulnerable populations. Even low doses significantly increase bleeding risk. Aspirin is strictly contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders or high bleeding risk. Healthcare provider consultation is essential before use.",
